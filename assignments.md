You can download the assignments here. Also, check out each assignment page for any additional info.  

Assignments **must be submitted only through Quera**. Submissions via email to TA team members, the Head TA, or the instructor **will not be accepted** and will receive a grade of **zero**.  

Questions related to assignments will be answered **only in the chat section of the respective assignment on Quera**. TAs are **not responsible** for answering questions in the Telegram group.  

Each assignment consists of **separate theoretical and practical sections**, including:  
- **4 theoretical exercises**  
- **1 comprehensive practical exercise** covering all syllabus topics.  

**All assignments have official solutions**, and once solutions are published, **no further submissions will be graded**.  

Each assignment allows for **5 days of late submission**. However, across all **4 assignments**, you have a total of **10 late days** available.  

**Late days for theoretical and practical sections are counted separately**, meaning you have **10 late days for theoretical exercises and 10 late days for practical exercises** across all 4 assignments.  

**For every hour of unauthorized delay, 0.5% of your grade will be deducted**.  

You can submit **grade appeals** through the following link:  
[**Grade Appeal Form**](https://forms.gle/YDEWmXzy39zhWcFHA)  

**Important:** Any communication with the TA team outside of this form (e.g., Telegram or any other platform) will result in an immediate **zero grade** for the assignment.  
**Appeals must be submitted only through the Google Form above.**
