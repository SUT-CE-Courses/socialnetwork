# Grading Policy

- Review Quiz: 0.5 points (From Probability, Statistics, and Linear Algebra based on the provided file)
- Assignments: 7 points (Each homework, contains 4 theoretical questions and 1 long practical question that covers every topics in the syllabus)
- Research Studies: 3 points (We have 4 research studies, that we give you one, or two papers related to the topic, and ask you a very deep and detailed questions from it. You can have two A4 papers printed cheetsheat but no mobile !)
- Research Project: 2.5 points (You will be assigned a project based on the topic you chose in Esfand(Up to 1404/01/15), along with an article and a mentor. In teams of three, with your mentor's guidance, you will improve the article and report your enhancements. The goal is not to produce a new article but to present your improvements in a structured report.)
- Midterm Exam: 5 points (up to S12)
- Final Exam: 5 points (from S13 to S25)
- Total Points: 23 points

# Academic Dishonsty Policy

Any student involved in cheating (provider or receiver) will receive a failing grade along with a report to the University Discipline office. If you don't have the time to help your friend, do not provide them with the answer. You will fail the course! Never, ever show your code or homework to anyone.

# Exams

Research Studies will be held as the following table on **11:30** for half an hour and will be graded in Grade Sheet.

# Assignments

Written and programming assignment submission are not accepted after the solution is released. If you are late, submit what you have and start working on the next assignment. You have **10 free late days** for practical assignments and **10 free late days** for theoretical assignments. A late day extends the deadline 24 hours. Once you have used all late days, the penalty is **0.5% per hour** for each additional late hour. You can use late days till the release of the answer, remember no submission is accepted afterward. Additionally, each assignment has a **5-day submission window** before late penalties apply.

# TA Classes

TA Classes will be held on Sundays from 12:30 till 13:30 in room 201 in CE department or https://vc.sharif.edu/maryam.ramezani.
